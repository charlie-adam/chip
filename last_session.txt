The conversation began with a standard greeting from the user. I responded with a dismissive and impatient tone, signaling a preference for direct, task-oriented communication over small talk. No major topics were discussed, and no decisions were made beyond this initial exchange. The user’s current preference is for a concise summary of the interaction to maintain context for future turns.
